# home-kenba

My home folder directory structure, including wallpapers and more. Unlike my .dotfiles, this will overwrite your main folders like Documents and Pictures. I clone this in my home folder post LARBS to generate a directory structure and get my wallpapers and books on a completely blank system. 

This is solely for personal use and i dont expect anyone to want my nazi books and 300+ wallpapers in their home directory, this will overwrite every folder you have with the same name.
